# the skull has a shader to increase and decrease its size over time in a loop, this does this by multiplying the coordinates by a float over one and then one under one.
# it does this off of a cos value that signifies when the skull gets larger and smaller.
#Second we have a portrait with a screen space shader that displays a texture and moves where on the texture it is displaying based off of how it is moved in world space. (tutorial followed to create this linked in code)
# Thrid we have a multi-light phong shader that also displays on top of a texture. the ball adn the lights around it are all animated using the animation tool to show that it is working live and responds to botht the light moving and the ball rotating
# the source code for this shader is linked inside of it!
